为了满足系统实时性的要求，该系统必须在规定的时间内对外部事件（比如中断）作出响应。因此我们需要考虑机制、配置，以及实现的规则等等。

<!-- In order to fulfill the requirements of a real-time system, a system must react to an external event like an interrupt within a defined time frame. Therefore several mechanisms, configurations and implementation rules have to be considered. -->

## 1. Technical Basics

正在运行的低优先级的任务必须允许重要的实时任务抢占它。抢占取决于任务调度策略的规则。实时系统中另外一个重要的方面是保证实时任务对某些资源的互斥使用。

<!-- Currently running tasks with low priority must be preempted to allow the real-time critical task to run. Preemption depends on the rules of the task’s scheduling policy. Another important aspect in a real-time system is the guaranteeing the exclusive use of certain resources for real-time tasks. -->

## 2. Technical details of PREEMPT_RT patch

PREEMPT_RT patch的主要目标是*让kernel中不可抢占的代码量最小化*（参见[A realtime preemption overview](https://lwn.net/Articles/146861/)，我复制下来放到“链接资料及翻译”中了）。因此需要替换一些机制，并实现一些新的机制。

<!-- The main aim of the PREEMPT_RT patch is to *minimize the amount of kernel code that is non-preemptible* 1). Therefore several substitution mechanisms and new mechanisms are implemented. -->

## 3. HOWTOs

There are three categories of HOWTOs:

* [RTOS and RT application](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/howto/applications/start)

* [RT Debugging](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/howto/debugging/start)

* [RT tools and utilities](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/howto/tools/start)

## 4. Publications

这一部分在网站上还没有完善，目前处于空缺状态，可以时不时去[页面地址](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/publications)看看有没有更新。

<!-- Several real-time related publications can help broaden your knowledge about real-time systems.

## 5. Known Limitations

Some functionality is not available on RT because its implementation is not compatible with RT. Those limitations may apply to the to the kernel as a whole or may apply to specific architecture or platforms.
