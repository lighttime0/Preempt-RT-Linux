# 2.0 Technical details of PREEMPT_RT patch

> 原网页地址：https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/technical_details/start

PREEMPT_RT patch的主要目标是让kernel中不可抢占的代码量最小化。因此需要实现一些不同的机制，这些机制有部分已经包含在Linux mainline中了。

<!-- The main aim of the PREEMPT_RT patch is to minimize the amount of kernel code that is non-preemptible. Therefore different mechanisms are implemented. Those mechanisms are partially available in mainline Linux. -->

## 2.1 High resolution timers

高精度计时器（High Resolution Timer）让精确的定时调度成为可能，并且移除了计时器对全局变量`jiffies`的依赖。[“high resolution timer design notes”](https://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/High_resolution_timer_design_notes)里解释了高精度计时器的实现细节，现在已经是kernel documentation的一部分。

<!-- The high resolution timers allows precise timed scheduling and removes the dependency of timers on the periodic scheduler tick (jiffies). The “high resolution timer design notes” explain the implementation details for high resolution timer, they are part of the kernel documentation. -->

从Linux-2.6.24-rc1开始，高精度计时器patches就被完整的合并到mainline里，所以这个项目已经成为历史。之前都是包含在realtime preemption patch里的。

<!-- Since 2.6.24-rc1 the high resolution timer patches are fully merged and so the project is in “history mode”. Historically the high resolution timer patch was also integrated in the realtime preemption patch. -->

译者附注：jiffies是Linux中记录从电脑开机到现在总共的时钟中断次数的变量。硬件给内核提供一个系统定时器用以计算和管理时间，内核通过编程预设系统定时器的频率，即节拍率（tick rate)，每一个周期称作一个节拍（tick）。Linux内核从2.5版内核开始把频率从100调高到1000。

## 2.2 Sleeping spinlocks

在non-PREEMPT-RT模型中，spinlock直接映射到raw spinlock。任务B占有了一个spinlock后，后申请该spinlock的任务A会一直空转等待，直到任务B释放了该spinlock。在raw spinlock中，禁止抢占。在PREEMPT_RT模型中，spinlock被映射到sleeping spinlock，而raw spinlock保持原语义。一个等待sleeping spinlock的任务将会睡眠，当该spinlock被释放时，任务会被唤醒。在sleeping spinlock中，允许抢占。

<!-- In a non-PREEMPT-RT preemption model spinlocks are mapped onto raw spinlocks. A task waiting for a spinlock held by another task spins until the task holding the spinlock releases it. Preemption is disabled in raw spinlock context. In PREEMPT_RT spinlocks are mapped onto sleeping spinlocks, and raw spinlocks retain their behavior. A task waiting for a sleeping spinlock goes to sleep and is woken up when the spinlock is released. In the sleeping spinlock context preemption is not disabled. -->

## 2.3 Threaded interrupt handler

**这部分等把What are Interrupt Threads and How Do They Work?.pdf看完再翻译**

The PREEMPT_RT patch forces the mechanism of threaded interrupt handlers. Due to this all interrupt handlers run in a threaded context except they are marked with the IRQF_NO_THREAD flag. This mechanism can be forced also in Linux mainline kernel without PREEMPT_RT patch by the kernel command line option `threadirqs`. But there is a small difference in the resulted behavior.

## 2.4 rt_mutex

**这部分等把《奔跑吧，Linux内核》中的mutex看懂了再翻译**

All mutexes in the mainline Linux kernel are replaced by rt_mutexes. A rt_mutex implements priority inheritance to avoid priority inversion. This also applies to sleeping spinlocks and rwlocks. However, the holder of a semaphore can be preempted but does not participate in priority inheritance.

详见：2.4 rt_mutex

## 2.5 RCU

**这部分等把《奔跑吧，Linux内核》中的RCU看懂了再翻译**

RCU mechanisms in mainline Linux are only preemptible if CONFIG_PREEMPT is set (Preemption model: “Low-Latency Desktop”). The PREEMPT_RT preemption models both use preemptible RCU mechanisms. Additionally the PREEMPT_RT patch eliminates RCU handling from all intermediate states and processes it only in its own thread.
