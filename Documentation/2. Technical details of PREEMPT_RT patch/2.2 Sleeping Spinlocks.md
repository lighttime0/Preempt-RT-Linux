# 2.2 Sleeping Spinlocks

> 原网页地址：https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/technical_details/sleeping_spinlocks

自旋锁（spinlock）在kernel中用于保证在某个时刻最多只有一个线程可以访问临界区代码。相比于mutex，spinlock的优势在于使用简单、执行速度快。然而，如果锁保持的时间太长，或者与其它线程产生竞争的可能性增大时，spinlock可能会成为性能瓶颈，并且可能会造成延迟（latency）。延迟（latency）是实时系统中非常重要的一个问题。

<!-- Spinlocks are used in the kernel to guarantee only one thread at a time can be executing within a protected section of code. Their advantages over mutex locks are simplicity and speed of execution. However, if the lock is held too long or the odds of contention for it from other threads of execution becomes significant, spinlocks can become a performance bottleneck and a source of latency. Of course latency is a particularly important issue in real-time systems. -->

为了降低延迟，PREEMPT_RT patch将kernel中大部分的spinlock换成了rt_mutex。为了支持这项修改的基础工作大部分已经合并到主线了，它们包括减少临界区代码量，以及增加一个新的类型，来区别真正的spinlock和修改后`spinlock_t`类型中使用的rt_mutex。为了最少地修改kernel代码，已有的`spinlock_t`数据类型和使用它们的函数保持不变，但是当PREEMPT_RT开启后，`spinlock_t`会映射为rt_mutex。不幸的是，这可能会让阅读代码的人误解，因为当PREEMPT_RT开启时，`spinlock_t`不是一个真正的spinlock。

<!-- In order to reduce latency the PREEMPT_RT patch converts the majority of kernel spinlocks into rt_mutex locks. The underlying changes necessary to support this have mostly been upstreamed already. These include changes to reduce the scope of code executed with a lock held, and the addition of a new type to distinguish true spinlocks from the rt_mutex used inside the modified spinlock_t type. In order to minimize the changes to the kernel source the existing spinlock_t datatype and the functions which operate on it retain their old names but, when PREEMPT_RT is enabled, now refer to an rt_mutex lock. Unfortunately this is somewhat confusing when reading the code, since a spinlock_t is not really a spinlock when PREEMPT_RT is enabled. -->

因为sleeping spinlock允许抢占，所以它们不能被锁上，即使抢占和中断disabled。如果某处的spinlock必须上锁，必须使用原来的spinlock。

<!-- Since sleeping spinlocks obviously need to allow preemption they cannot be locked while preemption or interrupts are disabled. If this is necessary a traditional spinlock must be used. -->

当rt_mutex由于某种原因不适合使用时，代码必须修改为使用`raw_spinlock_t`，`raw_spinlock_t`保持原来的spinlock的语义。**后面这半段需要更深入了解raw_spinlock才能翻译**

When an rt_mutex lock cannot be used for some reason the code must be changed to use the new raw_spinlock_t, which forces traditional spinlock behavior. It is also necessary to use the corresponding raw_* variants of the spinlock functions when operating on this newer datatype. Some older documentation on PREEMPT_RT states that the old function names are used with the new datatype and the actual lock type is detected automatically, but this is not currently the case. The datatype and functions used to operate on it must match.
