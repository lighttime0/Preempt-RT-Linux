# 3.1.2.5 Memory for Real-time Applications

> 原网页地址：https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/howto/applications/memory

对内存进行恰当的管理可以提高实时程序的确定性。实时程序需要考虑的三个内存管理的内容包括：

<!-- Proper handling of memory will improve a real-time application's deterministic behavior. Three areas of memory management within the purview of a real-time application are considered : -->

1. Memory Locking
2. Stack Memory for RT threads
3. Dynamic memory allocation

请记住[usual sequence](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/howto/applications/application_base)首先让一个程序首先作为常规程序（非实时的）开始运行，然后用合适的资源和调度参数创建RT线程。

<!-- Keep in mind that the [usual sequence](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/howto/applications/application_base) is for an application to begin its execution as a regular (non-RT) application, then create the RT threads with appropriate resources and scheduling parameters. -->

### Memory Locking

Memory locking的APIs允许程序指示kernel去将（部分或者全部）虚拟内存的页和真正的页框关联起来，并保持这个关联。换句话说：

<!-- Memory locking APIs allow an application to instruct the kernel to associate (some or all of its) virtual memory pages with real page frames and keep it that way. In other words : -->

Memory locking的APIs

* Memory locking APIs will trigger the necessary page-faults, to bring in thepages being locked, to physical memory. Consequently first access to a locked-memory (following an `mlock*()` call) will already have physical memory assigned and will not page fault (in RT-critical path). This removes the need to explicitly pre-fault these memory.

* Further memory locking prevents an application's memory pages, from being paged-out, anytime during its lifetime even in when the overall system is facing memory pressure.

应用程序可以使用`mlock(…)`或者`mlockall(…)`来进行memory locking。这些C库函数的具体说明请参见[The GNU C Library: Locking pages](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Locking-Pages.html)。需要注意的是，应用程序必须有足够的特权级才能调用这些函数。

<!-- Applications can either use `mlock(…)` or `mlockall(…)` for memory locking. Specifics of these C Library calls can be found here [The GNU C Library: Locking pages](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Locking-Pages.html). Note that these calls requires the application to have sufficient privileges (i.e. [CAP_IPC_LOCK capability](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)) to succeed. -->

`mlock(<addr>, <length>)`会锁住指定的页（通过*address*和*length*参数指定），`mlockall(…)`会在物理内存中锁住程序全部的虚拟地址空间（也就是说，[globals](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/howto/applications/memory/mlockall_globals_sample), stack, heap, code都会锁住）。用户需要在方便使用和锁住过多RAM中作出权衡，来决定使用那个函数。只锁住RT-threads使用的那些内存（使用`mlock(…)`）的开销更小，不加分辨地使用`mlockall(…)`虽然方便，但会锁住程序的所有内存（也就是说，那些只有非实时线程使用的内存也会被锁住）。

<!-- While `mlock(<addr>, <length>)` locks specific pages (described by *address* and *length*), `mlockall(…)` locks an application's entire virtual address space (i.e [globals](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/howto/applications/memory/mlockall_globals_sample), stack, heap, code) in physical memory. The trade-off between convenience and locking-up excess RAM should drive the choice of one over the other. Locking only those areas which are accessed by RT-threads (using `mlock(…)`) could be cheaper than blindly using `mlockall(…)` which will end-up locking all memory pages of the application (i.e. even those which are used only by non-RT threads). -->

下面的代码片段演示了如何使用`mlockall(…)`：

<!--The snippet below illustrates the usage of `mlockall(…)` :-->

```C
  /* Lock all current and future pages from preventing of being paged to swap */
  if (mlockall( MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE )) { 
          perror("mlockall failed");
          /* exit(-1) or do error handling */
  }
```

Real-time applications应该在尽早地使用memory-locking APIs，要在执行real-time activities前使用，这样才不会在RT的关键路径上发生page-faults。没有这样做的话会影响程序的确定性。

<!-- Real-time applications should use memory-locking APIs early in their life, prior to performing real-time activities, so as to not incur page-faults in RT critical path. Failing to do so may significantly impact the determinism of the application. -->

注意，memory locking is required irrespective of whether *swap area* is configured for a system or not。这是因为当系统内存吃紧时，只读内存区域（比如程序代码）的页可能会从内存中drop。这样的只读页（和on-disk copy相同），将会直接放回硬盘（而不是放入swap area），这会导致

Note that memory locking is required irrespective of whether *swap area* is configured for a system or not. This is because pages for read-only memory areas (like program code) could be dropped from the memory, when the system is facing memory pressure. Such read-only pages (being identical to on-disk copy), would be brought back straight from the disk (and not swap), resulting in page-faults even on setups without a swap-memory.

### Stack Memory for RT threads

一个程序内的所有线程（包括实时的和非实时的）都有自己私有的栈。推荐的做法是程序应该知道所有RT线程需要多大的栈，并在创建这些线程前明确地设置好对应的栈。这可以通过调用`pthread_attr_setstacksize(…)`来实现，稍后的代码片段中有示例。如果如果栈的大小没有明确地设置好，线程将会获得一个默认大小的栈（`pthread_attr_getstacksize()`函数可以用于获取这个默认的大小，在编写Doc时是8MB）。

<!-- All threads (RT and non-RT) within an application have their own private stack. It is recommended that an application should understand the stack size needs for its RT threads and set them explicitly before spawning them. This can be done via the `pthread_attr_setstacksize(…)` call as shown in the snippet below. If the size is not explicitly set, then the thread gets the default stack size (`pthread_attr_getstacksize()` can be used to find out how much this is, it was 8MB at the time of this writing). -->

上面提到的`mlockall(…)`足以锁住线程在内存中全部的栈，所以线程的栈在使用时不会发生pagefaults。如果程序会产生大量的RT线程，为了不让内存耗尽，建议声明一个更小的栈（比默认值小）。

<!-- Aforementioned `mlockall(…)` is sufficient to pin the entire thread stack in RAM, so that pagefaults are not incurred while the thread stack is being used. If the application spawns a large number of RT threads, it is advisable to specify a smaller stack size (than the default) in the interest of not exhausting memory. -->

```C
 static void create_rt_thread(void)
 {
         pthread_t thread;
         pthread_attr_t attr;
 
         /* init to default values */
         if (pthread_attr_init(&attr))
   	         error(1);
         /* Set a specific stack size   */
         if (pthread_attr_setstacksize(&attr, PTHREAD_STACK_MIN + MY_STACK_SIZE))
   	        error(2);
         /* And finally start the actual thread */
         pthread_create(&thread, &attr, rt_func, NULL);
 }
```

细节：调用`mlockall(MCL_CURRENT)`时，程序中所有线程的全部栈都会强制放入RAM中。调用`mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE)`之后创建的线程将会在创建时立即产生page faults，于是新的栈立即强制放入RAM（因为MCL_FUTURE标志）。

Details: The entire stack of every thread inside the application is forced to RAM when `mlockall(MCL_CURRENT)` is called. Threads created after a call to `mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE)` will generate page faults immediately (on creation), as the new stack is immediately forced to RAM (due to the MCL_FUTURE flag). So all RT threads need to be created at startup time, before the RT show time. With `mlockall(…)` no explicit additional prefaulting necessary to avoid pagefaults during first (or subsequent) access.

### Dynamic memory allocation in RT threads

Real-time threads应该避免在RT关键路径上动态申请／释放内存。对于real-time threads建议的做法是在进入RT关键路径前申请。之后如果这些提前申请的动态内存按上面的描述锁住的话，RT线程的RT关键路径就可以使用它们了。

<!-- Real-time threads should avoid doing dynamic memory allocation / freeing while in RT critical path. The suggested recommendation for real-time threads, is to do the allocations, prior-to entering RT critical path. Subsequently RT threads, within their RT-critical path, can use this pre-allocated dynamic memory, provided that it is locked as described [here](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/howto/applications/memory#memory-locking). -->

程序中非实时的线程没有动态内存申请／释放的限制。

<!-- Non RT-threads within the applications have no restrictions on dynamic allocation / free. -->
